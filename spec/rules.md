# Implementation Rules

These rules apply to every `spec/*/task*.md`. The generated graph and transport
contracts are the source of truth; business implementations and their tests are
user-owned extension points.

## Project invariants

- Project root: `example/`
- Graph: `example/graph/example.generated.yaml`
- Never edit a file whose name contains `generated`; those files are replaced
  during project merge.
- Never change generated signatures, topology wiring, IDs, config keys, or
  transport contracts in order to make an implementation easier.
- Change `.proto`/OpenAPI source and regenerate; never patch generated bindings.
- Preserve the message/stream context received from the framework.
- Do not keep mutable per-request state in function objects: function instances
  are created once and may process requests concurrently.
- Finish one task at a time and immediately copy its completion line to
  `spec/progress.md`.

## Services

| Service | Language | Directory |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| `Analytics Service` | `Rust` | `analyticsservice/` |
| `Automation Service` | `Go` | `automationservice/` |
| `Inventory Service` | `Rust` | `inventoryservice/` |
| `Order Service` | `Rust` | `orderservice/` |


## Go rules

- Business functions are structs implementing the generated servicelib
  interfaces. Keep their generated method signatures.
- Pass the received `context.Context` to collectors, senders and callbacks.
  `context.Background()` and `context.TODO()` are forbidden in business paths.
- Makers may perform asynchronous initialization. Generated initializer groups
  run them through `errgroup`; they must honor cancellation and must not detach
  initialization work from the group.
- Preserve generated maker parameters and their order: cancellable group
  context, runtime environment, then the exact typed function, stream,
  endpoint, connector or service configuration. Runtime-owned router, handler
  or owner values are additional explicit typed arguments where required;
  makers must not recover these inputs from globals.
- Use generated `Makefile` targets:
  - regenerate: `make gen`
  - build: `make build`
  - test: `make test`
  - lint: `make lint`
- Implement generated `*_test.go` files.
- Import the public transformation API expected by the generated stub; do not
  bypass it by manually wiring runtime internals.









## Rust rules

- Business functions are user-owned structs implementing the servicelib traits
  used by generated stream construction. Keep the trait methods and maker
  signatures unchanged.
- Propagate `MessageContext`, use the provided collectors and stream contexts,
  and await asynchronous operations. Do not block Tokio worker threads.
- Makers return `Future`s and each initializer group is joined concurrently by
  Tokio. Do not introduce native threads or a second executor.
- Keep generated ownership boundaries: payload values and `Arc` state must not
  outlive the request or graph lifecycle without an explicit runtime contract.
- Use the generated workspace commands for build and test; the canonical test
  command is `cargo test --workspace --all-targets`.
- Put meaningful unit tests in `#[cfg(test)]` modules next to user-owned
  functions.
- Do not modify `service.generated.rs`, `config.generated.rs`, generated
  protobuf modules, or generated OpenAPI models.





## Temporal Workflow determinism

- A function reached from a `temporalExecutionType: Workflow` endpoint is
  replayed by Temporal. It must be deterministic even when the same code is
  also reachable from an ordinary process-side endpoint.
- Do not perform network or filesystem I/O, read process environment or wall
  clocks, generate unrestricted random values, access process-side stores, or
  start native threads, executors, goroutines, asyncio tasks, or detached
  promises from Workflow business code.
- Use the existing generated graph APIs. `Delay` selects the official Temporal
  Workflow timer automatically; `TaskPool` and `PriorityTaskPool` select the
  generated deterministic workflow-local schedulers.
- Emit logs, metrics and traces only through the framework interfaces supplied
  to the Workflow. They are backed by the official replay-safe SDK APIs; never
  call process exporters from Workflow code.
- Go Workflow code must pass the generated `golang-workflowcheck` target.
  Python Workflows run in the official default sandbox. TypeScript Workflows
  are bundled by the official SDK, but deterministic user code remains the
  author's responsibility.


## Endpoint and serialization rules

- External request/response types belong to protobuf/OpenAPI contracts.
- Internal stream types belong to the language backend's model package.
- Convert between external and internal types in endpoint handlers.
- Add serialization only where data crosses a process/storage boundary.
- For source endpoints, verify a real request and include the command in the
  task completion entry when the task asks for it.

## Priority of truth

1. Current task file.
2. Graph definition.
3. `.proto`/OpenAPI source contracts.
4. Generated type signatures.
5. servicelib runtime semantics for the selected language.
